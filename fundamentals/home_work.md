1. Write a programme in C that will convert a string to ASCII and then use interger calculation to convert the same string to Upper Case or lower case

2. Write the C programme for Armstrong number, perfect number and happy number

3. Write a C programme to enter a username and print the initials in upper case (your are not allowed to use string.h)

4. Write a C programme to compute the nPr and nCr of inputs n and r

5. Implement the same matrix multiplication algorithm in C. (Using Functions)

Suppose you matrix of 3X3 dims say A and B, then I want the C code to have the output A*B

A*B != B*A

6. whatever patterns we did in python can be done in C as well, albeit a little bit difficult
