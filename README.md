## üîß Compilation Quick Start

Each module includes a **Makefile** for easy compilation:

```bash
# Navigate to any module
cd 03-control-flow

# Compile all programs
make

# Run programs
./conditionals
./loops
./switch_demo

# Clean up compiled files
make clean

# Use Clang instead of GCC
make CC=clang
```

üìò **For detailed compilation instructions**, see [COMPILATION_GUIDE.md](./COMPILATION_GUIDE.md)

### Available Make Targets

Most modules support these targets:
- `make` - Compile all programs
- `make clean` - Remove compiled files
- `make run` - Compile and run all programs
- `make run-buggy` - Run buggy examples (educational)
- `make debug` - Compile with debug symbols
- `make asan` - Compile with AddressSanitizer (memory error detection)

### Example Compilation

```bash
# Module 03: Control Flow
cd 03-control-flow
make                    # Compile with GCC
make CC=clang          # Compile with Clang
make run               # Run all correct examples
make run-buggy         # Run buggy examples

# Module 06: Pointers
cd ../06-pointers
make asan              # Compile with memory sanitizer
./pointer_basics

# Module 07: Memory Management
cd ../07-memory-management
make valgrind          # Run with Valgrind (if installed)
```
